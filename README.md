# ECE 271B: Shopping Recommendation

Recommendation system has been a popular topic in the past few decades due to the increasing amount of information in our life. It is an important approach in solving the information overloading problem, and has been applied to many areas, such as product recommenders for online stores and content recommenders for social media platforms. In this work, two algorithms are introduced to solve the Amazon fine food recommendation problem, which are collaborative filtering and latent factor model. These algorithms are used to predict the ratings of users to products, and generate a recommendation list for users. The results of both models are shown in the end.

## Models
### Collaborative filter (CF)
+ User-based CF
+ Item-based CF

### Latent factor model
